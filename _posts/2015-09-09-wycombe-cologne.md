title: Day 1&#58; High Wycombe to Cologne
---

With a newly fitted gearbox on Tuesday afternoon, Nick drove the Land Rover to Thomas' house in High Wycombe, where we all stayed the night, to allow for a quick getaway round the M25 in the morning. The car was emptied and repacked late on Tuesday evening, with various items culled from the trip, in the name of space - at last though, all for four people can fit in the car!

The M25 and M20 were sadly familiar to us, but the last of British motorways and sliproads (they really are quite good!) we would see for a while. 

Waiting to get on the same ferry at Dover were a Triumph car club going on a European rally in ten different countries. Mostly Spitfires, a few others and a lonely Jetson (which Nick found amusing).

Getting off at the very industrial port of Dunkirke, we filled a nearly empty tank (escaping George Osborne's fuel duty) and started heading to Cologne; considering the time we got off the ferry - 4pm, we thought Cologne a good distance to travel and be in a position to get to Graz the next day.
