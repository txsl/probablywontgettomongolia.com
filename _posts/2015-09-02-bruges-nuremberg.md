title: Day 1&#58; Bruges to Nuremberg
---

Nice and early 5.30am wake up. Leave with enough time to hopefully reach Graz, Austria in the evening. 1200km is a long drive by any standards, but a 6am breakfast of Waffles in the car (to fulfil Belgian stereotypes) was a good start to a long day.

Autobahn driving is proving tricky as we're faster than the many, many lorries but not quick enough for the cars that aren't a heavily loaded flying brick and want to make use of the high speed limits.

Sixty kilometres south of Frankfurt with Thomas in the driving seat the engine suddenly screams and the car slows. Fifth gear won't engage so we get to the nearest motorway exit in fourth. More inspection in a lay-by reveals that all the gears do engage (with a nice new crunching sound), except fifth. Autobahn cruising just got even slower; we have to sit with the lorries at 90 kmph. We realise we have 3 options:

1. Go on and accept this speed limit that our car has imposed upon us
2. Return to the UK where we can get the car fixed relatively cheaply and quickly, with parts in stock
3. Send a new gearbox ahead on our route to someone who can fit it for us

Finding a local McDonalds (Thomas also discovered a new German burger called the McVeggie (why is this not in the UK?!)), we sit there using the free internet to contact friends and people who might be able to help or advise us. Getting the repair and spare part in mainland Europe looks possible but at a high cost of time and money.

Johannes' grandparents (in Austria) contacted their neighbour's garage, who offered to repair the fifth gear for a good price. Worth a try, so we drive on to Nuremberg, deciding that returning to the UK would be the least cost and time effective of our options. The most memorable part of this city was walking past by the reddest red light district even seen. Its name, Frauentormauer, is a superb German compound word meaning something like "women's wall gate".
