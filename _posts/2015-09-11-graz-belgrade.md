title: Day 3&#58; Graz to Belgrade
---

An overnight stay in Graz at Johannes' house was an enjoyable experience for all, and we woke up later than usual. The morning consisted of admin (scanning lots of documents so we can hand copies to any officials who may want to inspect, and then hold the originals to ransom) and car work: Nick managed to clean all the sea salt from the ferry crossings (the Land Rover is too big for the car deck so was put at the front of the ferry in the open and got covered in salt water spray).

Leaving later be planned at 2:30pm, we set out for Belgrade. Enjoying yet more Strabag built highways, we smoothly cruised through South Austria, Slovenia, Crotia and finally Serbia. Visiting four countries in one day is not bad going! Although maybe we shouldn't consider driving through a country's highway a 'visit'...

Thanks to the EU, we only had to stop at the border into Serbia (which is not part of the EU). The border guard politely asked, with a smile, if we were carrying any guns or drugs, to which we smiled back and confirmed we did not. He then proceeded to dig around his desk for a while, and give us some flyers welcoming us to Serbia but also asking if we could help them stamp out Police corruption by not paying bribes.

The drive to Belgrade was smooth (thanks again, Strabag). We found a great parking spot round the corner of the hostel we were staying at, only to realise that it was reserved for the French Ambassador! Deciding it best not to cause an International Incident, a quick move and the car was parked for the night. Four gyros (Greek kebabs) later, and goodnight Belgrade.
