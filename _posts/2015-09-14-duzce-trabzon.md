title: Day 6&#58; Düzce to Trabzon
---


The drive from Düzce to Trabzon (across a large part of Turkey) was another long day of driving, made more interesting by other motorists and roadside attractions along the way.

We went back on the highway which needed a toll transponder, and once again tried to pay but this post office clearly didn't want us to be their problem and told us to go to the post office in the next town. Thankfully the highway (and toll gates which sounded the alarm when we drove through) did not last for much longer, but the Strabag-esque roads continued for the entire day. Despite the roads being Strabag quality, the users of the road were certainly different to what we'd seen in Wesern Europe: driving in the hard shoulder, driving the wrong way down the hard shoulder, reversing back along the hard shoulder, tractors driving both ways in the hard shoulder, motorcyclists riding without any kind of safety gear or indeed a visible license plate, and a lack of lane discipline. All part of driving on Turkish highways!

Our attempts at an in car lunch (to avoid stopping and save time) did not work out as planned - cheese from the morning turned into a butter like substance which only a couple of us were brave enough to eat (for the record, it was still perfectly edible!).

We named one town 'Transit Town', so called because it had dealer after dealer who specialised in (all ex-Western Europe) old Ford Transit vans. There were hundreds of Transit Vans lined up along the main road. Brand loyalty comes a long way...

After another successful negotiation in price from 250 EUR to 40 EUR, we stayed the night in a hotel overlooking the town's main bus station (comprised almost entirely of Ford Transit vans, of course).
