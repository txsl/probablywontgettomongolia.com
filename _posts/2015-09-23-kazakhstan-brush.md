title: Day 15&#58; The Kazakhstan Brush
---

Camping meant that we woke up with the sun, packed up and were on the road by 8am. The first sections of road were very smooth; almost as if Strabag had come all the way from Europe and built them. It was too good to be true, and soon enough we were divered off the road onto a dirt track. The new Strabag road was still under construction, and we found that progress was much better if we drove back up the embamkment onto the road and used what road they had got round to building. This was mostly OK, apart from the gaps where there was only dirt, and one particularly alarming part where they had half built a bridge.

After the construction the road was good heading north through the towns of Beyneu and Kulsary, and George was able to confirm our route with a friendly Kamaz truck driver but after we turned East towards Aktobe they took a turn for the worse. Soon we had to resort to the dirt tracks across the steppe that spread out from the road wherever the surface was bad. After a good bit of off road driving we noticed the securing bolts for the roof box were falling off. Strapping it down with a ratchet, we decided to head off the road and strike camp for the night in a palaeoreef (Nick tells us that's what it's called, once again using his Geology knowledge).
