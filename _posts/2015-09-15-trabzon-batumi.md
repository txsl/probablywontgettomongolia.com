title: Day 7&#58; Trabzon to Batumi
---

The aim for the day was to get to Batumi, Georgia, and apply for our Azerbaijani visas ASAP (if we aren't able to get into Azerbaijan, we would have to rethink a large part of the route, probably driving from Georgia into Russia). Sources on the internet said visa issue times could vary from a few hours to a few days, or not at all if they run out of visa stickers. We set out very early (leaving at 6am) in order to get to the Turkish-Georgian border early and avoid a long queue.

The drive to the border was uneventful, with Johannes driving at 110 km/h for almost the entire morning (including through towns). The scenery changed and as we got closer to the border the landscape became more less arid and more green. The Turkish border guard indicated to the passengers in the car that we needed to cross the border as foot passengers (pointing to us and using his fingers to show that we should walk). Leaving Nick on his own, he was asked for the 'car passport' and then had to show customs officers around the car (including the roof box which once opened as instructed, they waved him to shut it, not looking inside it).

A short drive and we were at the Azerbaijan Consulate in Batumi. After having our passports inspected outside, we were told to wait for an unspecified length of time outside, until the office was ready to see us. After a few hours and some to-ing and fro-ing with dates, we had our Azeri visas issued!

Whilst driving to Batumi, we noticed a new noise when steering the car. The Power Steering Fluid level seemed low, and when parked up we noticed a puddle of red (power steering) fluid underneath the car. After the visas were issued, Nick and Johannes set to work finding the source of the leak, with George and Thomas looking for replacement fluid. After chatting with a helpful mechanic who George was convinced could be Mario from Mario Kart, the fluid was purchased, the source of the leak found and the car back to normal.

The rest of the day was spent exploring Batumi, the seaside resort town of Georgia. Watching the sunset across the Black Sea whilst swimming in it was spectacular, and a good end to a successful day.
