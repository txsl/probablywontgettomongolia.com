title: Day 2&#58; Cologne to Graz
---

We set ourselves the target of driving approximately nine hundred kilometres (five hundred and sixty miles, for those who like Imperial units). Thankfully, the Autobahns were in our favour and with comparatively little traffic along the way and no major traffic jams, we cruised for eleven hours solid (nope, we didn't stop for lunch) and arrived in Graz for a lovely dinner cooked by Johannes' mother.

On the subject of Autobahns, we learnt that they like to do roadworks a little different in Germany to the UK. For many kilometres at a time, traffic is subject to a contraflow and an 80 km/h speed limit. It also seems that almost every site is under the management of a company called Strabag. Contraflow after contraflow we would see the Strabag logo, with their strapline '_Teams work_'. We saw so much Strabag that taglines like 'you know when you've been Strabaged' and 'We love you Strabag, oh we do' _may_ have been chanted.

Austria also has Strabag contraflows, although not as many as Germany. Their tunnel network which the autobahns flowed through was quite impressive - plenty of them with a hefty toll to go through them. At least they got you there quickly - later on in the trip we will probably come to appreciate Strabag and toll roads!

One other trait we noticed about European driving is that lorries seem to enjoy straddling the hard shoulder. Lorries from all different countries do this. We aren't entirely sure why: maybe they are trying to take the racing line (or as close as they can try in a lorry) in the name of fuel efficiency, or perhaps they are concentrating on their phones?
