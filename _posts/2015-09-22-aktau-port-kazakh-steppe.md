title: Day 14&#58; Clearly Customs and heading to the Steppe
---

First things first, getting the car out of customs. We get there and talk to our friends from the ferry, who tell us that the corrupt customs officer was drunk last night and is now apparently really hungover.

We get to first window, and they're surprisingly pretty efficient. Second window likewise. Then we are sent into customs where we see our mate looking a bit worse for wear. The customs computer crashes, and the Latvian bikers get asked what the error messages mean as they speak English. So far so Soviet.

They spend ages looking at our documents, all nice but just very slow and taking lots of tea breaks. Eventually a nice customs officer looks at our forms, says its all fine and that we have to a wait a bit, what for we don't know (see the pattern emerging about this whole ferry trip?). 10 minutes later George manages to convince him to move us along to the next step. 

Nick then goes through into the customs area with our motorcyclist friends to another building where some very young soliders search the car. When they find the cigarettes their faces light up and Nick says Merry Christmas as he gives them each a pack of cigarettes. Apparently they were so thorough because there was a big drugs bust on the same ferry a few weeks ago. A more senior officer asks where we are going and where we are from, and then stamps some paperwork, and apparently everything is sorted.

Leaving the port we take photos with our friends from the ferry and exchange contact details, and head in to Aktau to load the car up. After a stop for fuel and food we are ready to finally hit the road to Astana. The roads were decent, although we hear that the roads further along can get quite bad. We get as far as a place called Shepte, and then pull off the road behind a hill for our first night of camping in the wilds of Kazakhstan.
