title: Day 1&#58; London to Bruges
---

Normally when there are 4 people in a car there should be enough space for them all to sit down. We'll get to the space for that 4th seat later as there are only three of us for now... On the topic of quality organisation, we picked up some last minute, but very important (hence leaving to the last minute), items - dollars, car decals etc.

George had milk and orange juice left over from home. Apparently when drunk together they result in near instant vomiting. Although tempting, we didn't try it. There was a kebab shop in Ilford called Grillford. Punny.

Using the offensively slow Wi-Fi on board the ferry, we decided that Bruges, Belgium would be a feasible, convenient, and interesting place to stop, even if we didn't come across any racist dwarves. It turns out French and Belgian signage is good enough not to require maps, and the drive to Bruges was pleasant.

It was dark when we made it into Bruges, often called one of the "Venices of the North" (Birmingham is another). This means that it is very beautiful and attracts all sorts of wonderful tourists like us, but also weird Americans who think that walking around the central square with Go-Pros tied to their caps is an excellent idea. An expensive city, but a great place for our first stop and 5 hours' sleep before an early start tomorrow.

Onward to Graz, Austria.
