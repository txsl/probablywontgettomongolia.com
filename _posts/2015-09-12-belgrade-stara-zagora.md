title: Day 4&#58; Belgrade to Stara Zagora
---

We drove some way into Bulgaria from Belgrade (mostly smooth highways, thank you Strabag) and spent the night in the town of Stara Zagora. We booked a cheap hotel room with a non-smoking room which reeked of smoke anyway.

The town is close to an abandoned [UFO-shaped monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzludzha) which sits on the Buzludzha mountain peak, so we went to have a look. After driving through a few small towns on the way, we began to ascend the mountain up a winding road where a mild fog became thicker and until the visibility was only a few metres. Nick slowly drove us up the mountain until our maps told us we were at the monument but our eyes could only tell us what was a few metres in front of us - some steps. We climbed them until we saw the foggy outline of a spaceship on top of this very windy peak. We approached the monument and walked around it, only able to the old communist slogans and some graffiti slagging off communism. Although the weather didn't let us see much, it provided an interesting atmosphere. Definitely worth visiting if the weather is better.

After our semi-successful attempt at visiting this strange monument, we returned to Stara Zagora only to find that every shop and restaurant in town was closed, so we decided to cook for the first time on the trip. We took the gas cooker and some pasta up to our room to cook a basic meal in the bathroom (so as not to trigger the smoke alarm) and enjoy some wholesome traditonal Bulgarian music on the TV.
