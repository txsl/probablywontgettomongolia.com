## Thanks to

### ICTV

For the loan of their filming equipment. In particular, we would like to thank Pete Brook for his advice.

### MTF Training

Up hills, down hills, across sides of hills (avoid them!), through ditches and water features (and balancing your Land Rover on two telegraph polls!), Ian Shacklock of [MTF Training](http://www.mtfdrivertraining.co.uk/) took us on an afternoon off-road course. We left well prepared for any situation which could arise in the desert or mountains.

### Imperial College London ICT Department

For the use of two laptops on the trip (from which we are writing this blog!) Thanks to Kat Parkins, Mike Russell and Sonal Patel for making this happen.


### Max Hunter

Max has loaned us various bits of technology, including GoPros, hard disks and cabling to alter the electrics of our car - thank you!


## No Thanks to

### Land Rover's Fifth Gear

For breaking :(
